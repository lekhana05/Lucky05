 <h1>Hi I am Lekhana.Raya</h1>
    <h1>Welcome to my WEBSITE</h1>
    <p>I am  pursuing B.Tech at Gitam University Banglore, currently in my third year in, computer science department. I have an interest in reading, writing, and putting my thoughts into words. I love traveling because exploring ourselves is the best thing ever. I discovered many of my interests during this pandemic, and I am trying my best to improve them. So, coming to my university is a great place to explore ourselves. The best part is being with friends. These many holidays I never dreamt. My second year completed online hope that even in the 3rd year, I go to college. Missing my friends is the saddest part, but okay, I feel that time proved who I deserve and who deserves me. On this note, I end this paragraph but not my thoughts.</p>
